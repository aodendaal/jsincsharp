This is a very simple example of how to host JavaScript in a C# application using Microsoft.JScript

* Add reference to Microsoft.JScript
* Using reflection
  - Compile assesmbly from source or file
  - Get the type
  - Create instance of the type
  - Invoke the methods on the instance based on the type
* Only type and package definitions are allowed inside a library
